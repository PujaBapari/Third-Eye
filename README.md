# Third-Eye
The "Third Eye" project uses OpenCV to create a real-time face tracking system for online classes, enhancing student engagement by analyzing eye contact and providing feedback.


Our team has successfully developed "Third Eye," an innovative system designed to enhance engagement in online education through real-time eye contact analysis. Combining advanced robotics principles, functionality, and practicality, we proudly showcased this project during the 2024 Robotics Project Showcase for the course 'Introduction to Robotics.' Here's a breakdown of our creation:



Components Used



Software:

  Python

  Arduino IDE

  OpenCV



Hardware:

  Arduino UNO: The main controller for the system.

  USB Camera: Captures live video feed for face tracking.

  Servo Motor: Controls the camera’s pan and tilt movements.

  PVC Board: Forms the base structure for stability.

  Jumper Wires: Connects all electronic components.



Functionality



1. Face Tracking: A USB camera on a servo arm keeps a person’s face centered in the frame.

2. Autonomous Movement: Servo motors enable real-time panning and tilting to follow the subject.

3. Real-Time Feedback: Processes facial positioning instantly using OpenCV and Python for smooth, responsive tracking.



How does the face tracking system work?



  Face Detection: USB camera identifies face in real time.

  Centering: Calculates adjustments to keep the face centered.

  Servo Movement: Arduino-controlled servos pan/tilt the camera.

  Real-Time Tracking: Continuous adjustments as the person moves.



Check out the full code: 



Operation: The system detects a face using a USB camera, processes the feed with OpenCV and Python, and adjusts the camera's angle via Arduino and servo motors to keep the face centered, continuously tracking it in real time..
